          The vision for the YouView project was a continuously updated product that was on the cutting edge of user experience and incorperating the latest back and front end technologies.
          With this in mind, the YouView team decided to not rest on the laurels of the successful launch but to start the process of the next generation.

          <br><br>
          There were a few high-end goals the company had which created our boundaries to work within
        </p>
        <h2 style="color: #fff"> No Box Left Behind</h2>
        <p style="color: #fff">
          Every box since release had to support the next generation project
        </p>
        <h2 style="color: #fff"> Good, Better, Best</h2>
        <p style="color: #fff">
          A philosophy that different hardware could have different levels of software to enable the higher end devices to have a more robust feature set
        </p>
        <h2 style="color: #fff"> Built on HTML5</h2>
        <p style="color: #fff">
          The whole project would be rewritten from Flash into the more recent HTML5 to allow easy in updating the software for fast iterative changes

        <h2>High Level Concepting</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="main">
        <p>


          The first step in this whole operation was to gather people from across the company and sell them the vision of the next stage in the company. I worked alongside the Creative Director and a select few designers, engineers and testers and
          spent a few days away from the office to come up with some features which we would strongly like to be included.


          <br><br>

          At this point in the project, the idea was to create some really out of the box thinking, trying to incorporate future facing technologies and to really stay ahead of rivals products. We went into this stage knowing that most of these
          ideas may not be able to be incorporated in the first release of the software, but as the project was going to be an agile one with lots of iterations we could always wait for the right time to launch more extravagant features so they
          would go on the project backlog until ready.

          Looking at the whole user experience gave us the opportunity to really look at our designs again from scratch. Since the original YouView interface had been created, the televisions in peoples homes had become larger, with more features
          and more screen real estate, going from 720p being the norm all the way up to 8k and beyond.</p>

        <h2>The Guide</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="main">
        <p>

          The guide is the main way that people use the TV. In the house the guide is still the king of the service and as such it was a difficault sell to really try and change the Guide for the product too much. When we interviewed users of the
          service as well as users of other TV experiences the majority of users wanted to have an area which was familiar, and they could use without having to read a manual.
          <br><br>
          We looked at a few concepts and complete redesigns for the guide. One idea that we felt strongly about was the idea to bring imagery into the guide to give an instant view of TV shows currently on.
          <br><br>
          In the guide, one feature that has always been a unique selling point of the YouView product was the ability to go back 7 days and play content instantly from the tv guide. The date tracker on the guide was something it was agreed would
          have to stay and would also have to remain a predominant feature, alongside the filters to allow a user to quickly change the type of channel in the guide for the customer.

          The old version of youview had a main menu area which only conisted of the name of the section which would be selected.
          With the new designs we wanted to try and incorperate more visual content to allow the user quick access to the tv shows they enjoy.

          These results come from the user testing sessions with the final designs using a micxture of existing customers from all three user bases, BT TT and retail<br>
          This coming from in house user testing means the results are skewed and as such would not be indicative of a wider release<br>
          More than 80% of participents would use the help app as thier first point of call in the event of an error<br>
          The most hughly reguarded feature was the acess to most common issues<br><br>
          The imagery relating to the settings area was also highlighted as a way to quickly link areas

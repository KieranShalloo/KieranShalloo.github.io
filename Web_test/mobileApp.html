        <div class="main">
          <span>As it expanded its reach into the UK television market, YouView wanted to give their customers a way to remotely record the TV shows and Films they enjoy on the go. A feature much requested by existing users this app would be the
            first
            step into pushing the product to a much wider audience and being able to take the YouView experience out of the home.</span>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="main">
        <p>Work started with the YouView mobile app with the use of personas, we adjusted a few variables in relation to taking the product onto the small screen in the form of mobile phones and tablets. These new personas were created with the help
          of external agencies who we also outsourced our initial user research too. This company were brought in various times throughout the project to relay feedback and to help shape our vision of the product.</p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>

      <div class="main">
        <p>

          The first step in our thinking was how best to replicate the journeys the users had been accustomed to when using the product in the home.

          We wanted a consistent pattern in both platforms whilst also taking both the apple and android guidelines and creating consistency with the overall branding and UI of our existing work.

          The information architecture of the app was decided early, creating a strong foundation of hierarchy and a user centred approach to delivering the right information at the right time in order to benefit our users. Working alongside the
          Lead Interaction Designer we collaborated on various aspects of the the app, bouncing ideas with each other and using an agile approach to the workflow, creating a dynamic working relationship leading to furthering ideas and concepts.

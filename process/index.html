        <p>We took the initial research from previous accessibility work as a starting point for this new project. In the previous YouView design, the team worked very closely with partially sighted users for a constant stream of feedback and we
          continued this process we moved towards the next phase of the user interface.
          As a team, we were also in constant communication with two of the UKâ€™s biggest disability charities the RNIB and SCOPE to give us an insight into the challenges that people with disabilities face in day to day life.
          <br><br>
          A big part of our research came in the way of using a toolkit from the University of Cambridge which allowed the product design team to simulate mild vision loss. This toolkit consisted of glasses which replicated acuity and contrast
          loss.
          These glasses could then be stacked up on top of each other to analyse how different level of eyesight issues will affect the ability to see and interact with the product
          <br><br>
          We also spent time conducting competitive research in both the TV industry and wider, trying to get a sense of where the competition put their focus on helping disabled customers. By looking at rivals we could see where the gap in the
          market stood and how we could use our expertise to create a bespoke experience that solved the brief and created the best solutions
